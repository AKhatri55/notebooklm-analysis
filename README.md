Evidence and analysis for Q4(c) – Critical Evaluation of NotebookLM AI outputs.
This repository contains evidence used for Q4(c) of the university assessment, where critical evaluation of Google’s NotebookLM AI assistant was conducted.
The evaluation focused on three key areas:

##  Folder Structure

###  /accuracy/
- Screenshot and log demonstrating AI's correct, grounded response to technical accounting queries
- Example: Recognition of internally generated goodwill under AASB 138

###  /usefulness/
- Quiz generation and audio output features
- Demonstrates AI’s practical value in academic workflows such as study and revision

###  /limitations/
- Screenshots and notes where the AI gave unclear, incomplete, or misleading answers
- Tests include confusing wording around amortisation, and oversimplification of consolidation rules

##  Summary

The outputs were tested for accuracy, relevance, academic usefulness, and limitations such as hallucination, bias, and misunderstanding. Evidence logs and screenshots support the analysis submitted in Q4(c) of the main report.
